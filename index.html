      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 4, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Kara Tour is a simple tourism information app that provides details
        about hotels, tourist destinations, and tour prices in Uzbekistan. The
        app is designed to help users explore and learn about places of
        interest.
      </p>

      <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        This app does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
        There is no login, account creation, analytics, or tracking of user
        behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Content and Sources</h2>
      <p>
        All content in the app is informational and provided in the Uzbek
        language. The app includes images and descriptions of locations. Much of
        the information is based on publicly available content from Wikipedia,
        which has been translated for local understanding. Proper references are
        provided where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Kara Tour uses <strong>Google Maps API</strong> to display maps and
        preview the locations of tourist destinations. Google Maps may collect
        data such as your IP address, location (if you allow it), and device
        information, in accordance with
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          >Google’s Privacy Policy</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kara Tour does not access or store this data. All map-related features
        are powered and managed by Google.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Since Kara Tour does not collect personal data, there is no user data
        stored or processed within the app. However, external services like
        Google Maps may handle data securely according to their own terms and
        policies.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy if the app changes in the future. All
        changes will be posted on this page. However, as of now, the app remains
        a simple, offline informational tool.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Contact</h2>
